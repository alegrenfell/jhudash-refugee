Compatibility Model

This model operates on the basic principle that refugees will more successfully resettle in an area that is similar to their home country (before it was in crisis).  We considered 21 different variables to measure this similarity.  These variables fit broadly into three different categories:

1) Economic:
    - percent of GDP from industry/services/agriculture
    - education level of workforce
    - household expenditures, government expenditures, etc.

2) Social:
    - percentage of population that is Muslim
    - hospitals and physicians per 1000
    - percent of GDP spent on education and health care
    
3) Geographic Distance:
    - as the crow flies, from Damascus

We standardized all of these measures to be between 0 and 1, to minimize the effect of certain measures which vary wildly.  For instance Cyprus is 328 miles away, whereas New Zealand is 16,000.  Without standardization, this quickly becomes the deciding factor.
